## Overview

**BOAFOC (Basic Offline African-language Framework for Oral Communication)** is an **offline-first voice assistant framework** designed to support **African languages** on low-power edge devices such as the Raspberry Pi. The project enables speech-based interaction without relying on cloud services, making it suitable for low-connectivity environments and privacy-sensitive applications.

BOAFOC focuses on accessibility, language inclusion, and edge AI, providing a modular foundation for building voice-driven systems that work entirely on-device.

## Description

Modern voice assistants depend heavily on internet connectivity and offer limited support for African languages. BOAFOC addresses this gap by providing a **fully offline speech interaction pipeline**, combining speech recognition, language processing, and text-to-speech on affordable hardware.

The system captures audio input through a microphone, processes speech locally using offline models, interprets commands or queries, and responds using offline text-to-speech. Its modular architecture allows developers to add new languages, commands, or hardware modules with minimal changes.

BOAFOC is designed for use in education, accessibility tools, community kiosks, and research environments where reliable internet access is not guaranteed. By prioritizing local languages and on-device processing, the project promotes digital inclusion, data privacy, and sustainable AI development.
